## 80 (hotfix)
- Fix: prevent `NameError: spot_free is not defined` (and similar for earn_flex) in `_ensure_spot_usdc()`.
- Adds safe local defaults so error/notice messages are formatted even if upstream balances are missing.
- No behavior change to business logic; only stability of confirm flow and messaging.
